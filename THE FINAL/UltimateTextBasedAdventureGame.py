But fate had other plans. A horse's frantic gallop broke the forest silence. A messenger—mud-stained, wide-eyed—rode up and thrust a rolled parchment into John's hands. \n \n “The eight villages to the south have fallen! Invaded by mutant rats—thousands of them! And… and your friend George was taken.”\n \n The messenger fled almost immediately, as if the forest itself were unsafe. John's heart pounded with panic and anger. George—the one person who cared about him—captured by rats? The thought didn't make sense. But before John could process the message, he heard chittering behind him. He spun around. \n \nToo late. A swarm of grotesque, oversized rats leapt from the underbrush, their eyes glowing with eerie green light. They rushed him like a furry tidal wave, squeaking with unnatural coordination. John swung his axe wildly—but they overwhelmed him. He felt tiny claws on his arms, his legs, his shoulders. In seconds they wrenched the axe from his grip and vanished into the forest with it, carrying the iron-headed tool like a trophy. John was left panting, weaponless, and furious.")
