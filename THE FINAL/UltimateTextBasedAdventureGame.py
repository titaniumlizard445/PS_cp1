        print(f"John was a humble woodcutter who lived alone in a weather-beaten log cabin deep in the heart of the vast Greenwood Forest. The nearest village lay fifty miles away—far enough that John could go months without seeing another human soul, which suited him fine.\n \nHe had his trees, his fireplace, and his meals eaten with his trusty pair of chopsticks—a habit picked up from the rare Asian merchants who wandered close enough for trade. His only friend in the world was George—a wandering tinkerer who visited every few months with stories, odd inventions, and a warm smile that John secretly treasured. \n \n The Day Everything ChangedOne crisp autumn morning, John marched into the woods carrying his well-used axe, ready to split logs for winter. But fate had other plans. A horse's frantic gallop broke the forest silence. A messenger—mud-stained, wide-eyed—rode up and thrust a rolled parchment into John's hands. \n \n “The eight villages to the south have fallen! Invaded by mutant rats—thousands of them! And… and your friend George was taken.”\n \n The messenger fled almost immediately, as if the forest itself were unsafe. John's heart pounded with panic and anger. George—the one person who cared about him—captured by rats? The thought didn't make sense. But before John could process the message, he heard chittering behind him. He spun around. \n \nToo late. A swarm of grotesque, oversized rats leapt from the underbrush, their eyes glowing with eerie green light. They rushed him like a furry tidal wave, squeaking with unnatural coordination. John swung his axe wildly—but they overwhelmed him. He felt tiny claws on his arms, his legs, his shoulders. In seconds they wrenched the axe from his grip and vanished into the forest with it, carrying the iron-headed tool like a trophy. John was left panting, weaponless, and furious.")
