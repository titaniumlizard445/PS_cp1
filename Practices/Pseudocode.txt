PS 1st Pseudocode tic tac toe

import random 

declare a list that has 3 lists inside and has spaces or underscores in a row for each nested list

declare a variable to keep score

while loop until the user quits
    ask the user if they would like to be X or O and store that in a variable and make a variable that stores the opposite for the computer and make sure to tell them that x goes first O goes second
    Display the board (which is the list)

    game loop
    loop until game over
        
        checks to see if the player goes first or the computer goes first X or O


        
        check if the board is filled up completely
        checks to see if there is anything spaces in any of the lists
        if there is not
            break out of the loop
            display tie game
        or if there is space
            let the game continue


        loop until valid input and it is in a space
            Ask the player for which space they put their mark onto the board

            see if that space is already taken up
            if there is nothing there then get out of the loop
